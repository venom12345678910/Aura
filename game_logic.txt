## Lucky 7z Game (Slots)
---

The Lucky 7z game is a 3-reel slot machine. The outcome is determined by the symbols that land on the center line.

**Reel Composition:**
Each of the three reels is constructed from a "reel strip" that defines the frequency of each symbol. This determines the probability of landing on a specific symbol.
- Reel Strip: `['grape', 'bell', 'cherry', 'grape', 'seven', 'bar', 'grape', 'bell', 'grape', 'wild', 'cherry', 'bell', 'grape', 'seven', 'bar']`
- Total items on strip: 15

**Probabilities per Reel:**
- **Grape:** 5 out of 15 = ~33.3%
- **Bell:** 3 out of 15 = 20%
- **Cherry:** 2 out of 15 = ~13.3%
- **Seven:** 2 out of 15 = ~13.3%
- **Bar:** 2 out of 15 = ~13.3%
- **Wild (Diamond):** 1 out of 15 = ~6.7%

**Payout Table (Multiplier on Bet):**
- **3 Grapes:** 5x
- **3 Cherries:** 10x
- **3 Bells:** 15x
- **3 Bars:** 20x
- **3 Sevens:** 50x
- **3 Wilds (Jackpot):** 100x

**Note on Winnings Calculation:**
- The game pays out for a 3-of-a-kind match on the center line.
- **Wilds:** A 'Wild' symbol can substitute for any other symbol to form a winning line.
  - 1 Wild + 2 matching symbols: Pays as 3 matching symbols.
  - 2 Wilds + any other symbol: Pays 20x the bet.
  - 1 Wild + 2 different symbols: Pays 2x the bet as a consolation prize.

## Greedy Baby Game (Roulette)
---

The Greedy Baby game is a roulette-style wheel game with 8 items. Players can bet on individual items or on one of two categories.

**Game Items & Payouts:**
The wheel has 8 distinct items. Each item has an equal probability of being selected (1 in 8, or 12.5%). The payout is a multiplier on the bet placed on the winning item or category.

| Item        | Category | Payout Multiplier |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Chicken     | fastfood | 45x               |
| Apple       | fruits   | 5x                |
| Lemon       | fruits   | 5x                |
| Strawberry  | fruits   | 5x                |
| Mango       | fruits   | 5x                |
| Fish        | fastfood | 10x               |
| Burger      | fastfood | 15x               |
| Pizza       | fastfood | 25x               |

**Category Bets & Payouts:**
Players can also bet on broader categories.
- **Fruits:** Contains Apple, Lemon, Strawberry, Mango. Payout is 2x.
- **Fastfood:** Contains Chicken, Fish, Burger, Pizza. Payout is 2x.

**Winning Calculation:**
A player's total win for a round is the sum of their winning bets:
- `(Bet on winning item) * (Item's multiplier)`
- `+ (Bet on winning category) * (Category's multiplier)`

For example, if a player bets 100 on "Apple" and 500 on "Fruits", and the wheel lands on "Apple":
- Win from item bet: 100 * 5 = 500
- Win from category bet: 500 * 2 = 1000
- Total win: 1500
